# Lab Equipment Booking Smart Contract (Aptos Move)

## ðŸ“– Description
This smart contract is designed to manage **lab equipment reservations** on the Aptos blockchain.  
It introduces a simple booking flow where users can reserve equipment by staking a deposit of AptosCoins.  
The contract supports two main functions:
1. **book_equipment** â€“ Users can book a lab equipment time-slot by depositing tokens.
2. **cancel_booking** â€“ Users can cancel their booking and automatically receive their deposit back.

The contract ensures fair allocation of equipment while keeping the deposit locked during booking, thereby discouraging misuse.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
The vision of this project is to create a **transparent, trustless, and efficient lab equipment booking system** powered by blockchain.  
It removes the need for manual booking processes, ensures accountability through deposits, and provides secure automation for cancellations and refunds.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
While this prototype is simple, the system can be expanded to include:
- **NFT-based booking tickets** that can be transferred or traded.  
- **No-show slashing mechanism** where deposits are partially or fully forfeited if the user doesnâ€™t show up.  
- **Waitlist management** with automatic allocation and refunding.  
- **Multi-equipment support** for complex labs with many instruments.  
- **Admin dashboard** for managing equipment schedules and monitoring usage statistics.
